# AirBnB Clone - The Console

This project is the first step towards building a full web application. Here, we build a console application that simulates the backend logic of an AirBnB clone, including storage, serialization, and deserialization.

## Features
- `BaseModel`: Defines common attributes and methods.
- Serialization and deserialization.
- UUID and datetime handling.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `test_base_model.py` to test the functionality of `BaseModel`.
3. Use `unittest` to verify test cases.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- `pycodestyle` for linting.
